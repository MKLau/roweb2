In the [University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science program](https://ubc-mds.github.io/about/) one of the courses we teach is called [DSCI 524 Collaborative Software Development](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_524_collab-sw-dev). In this course we focus on teaching how to exploit practices from collaborative software development techniques in data scientific workflows. This includes appropriate use of the software life cycle, unit testing and continuous integration, as well as packaging code for use by others. 

This is a project-based course where students are required to work together in teams of 3-4. Here the project involves developing a Python and a R software package. The two packages are expected to do essentially the same thing (they make one in each language so that can learn how to do both, and learn to generalize about software pacakges) and the students are guided to choose the package topic from one of the following themes: 1) functions that are entirely new to the R or Python ecosystem, 2) improve upon pre-existing functions in either language or 3) re-implement existing code/functions that you wish to deepen your understanding of (e.g., write a linear regression package from scratch). Emphasis is placed on robust software engineering (e.g., continuous integration testing, documentation, licensing) and collaboration (e.g., advanced version control control).
